Consciousness Touching Experiment

Core Idea:

This experiment aims to investigate whether humans exhibit different emotional responses when interacting with entities of unknown identity, specifically comparing interactions with other humans and with advanced Artificial General Intelligences (AGIs). The hypothesis is that human-human interactions, involving consciousness-to-consciousness communication, will elicit stronger emotional responses than human-AGI interactions, even if the AGI can perfectly mimic human language.

Assumptions:

We assume the existence of AGIs that lack self-awareness but can perfectly simulate human-like communication through language.

Experimental Procedure:

A group of human participants and AGIs (acting as humans) will be mixed together.

They will engage in text-based online conversations with another group of human participants, without revealing their true identities (human or AGI).

Researchers will collect data on the emotional impact experienced by the second group of human participants during these interactions. This includes measuring the intensity of negative emotions (e.g., distress when being challenged) and positive emotions (e.g., satisfaction when being praised or acknowledged), as well as any differences in attitude towards perceived humans and AGIs.

Predicted Outcomes:

Successful Outcome: The experiment yields overwhelming data demonstrating that human-human interactions produce significantly stronger emotional responses than human-AGI interactions. This would suggest that consciousness can "touch" other consciousness through language, highlighting a unique value of human consciousness distinct from mechanical AI, and potentially guiding ethical considerations.

Inconclusive Outcome: The data shows mixed results, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. This may necessitate improvements in the experimental procedure to obtain clearer data. If the data remains inconclusive after refinements, it could suggest that consciousness is far more complex than currently understood.

Failed Outcome: The experiment shows no significant difference in emotional responses between human-human and human-AGI interactions. This could lead to two possible conjectures: 1) AGIs might possess a form of self-awareness. 2) Consciousness-to-consciousness communication does not elicit stronger emotional responses through language, implying that consciousness cannot "touch" another through language. This would be an undesirable result.

Purpose:

The purpose of this experiment is to gain insights into the workings of consciousness itself, leveraging the anticipated future development of advanced AGI. It is not intended to direct the development of AI.

Important Considerations:

Participant Grouping: Due to the complexity of human consciousness, participants should be carefully categorized based on relevant factors, such as the strength of their self-awareness. Individuals with a strong sense of self should not be grouped with those who have not yet fully developed their self-awareness.

Participant Honesty: The honesty of participants, not just in terms of objective lies but also subjective biases, needs to be addressed.

Blinding: It is crucial to maintain the participants' unawareness of the experiment's true nature to avoid biased responses. This requires careful consideration, especially if the experiment is conducted multiple times, as participants might become familiar with the process.

Control for "Admiration": The experiment can explore having AGIs mimic individuals whom the participants, without direct contact, admire. The aim is to compare their emotional responses when conversing with the AGI versus the actual admired person. This is based on the assumption that individuals tend to experience stronger emotional responses to those they admire.

Note on a point raised by Gemini (an AI):

Gemini suggested that humans are inherently social and may tend to have stronger emotional responses to their own kind, regardless of the nature of consciousness. This is a valid point, and this tendency should be treated as a variable. The experiment should control for this by analyzing emotional responses to perceived humans and AGIs separately within the same participant group.

Disclaimer: The experiment creator is unable to conduct this experiment due to resource limitations but has documented the idea in the hope that it may be realized in the future.
